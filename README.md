# Serial Port communication library for Android (with Java API)

This is a fork of a github project, it's been updated to use cmake instead of gcc and the most recent android studio toolchain.
Use the build-libs.sh to build the aar file which is required by the bindings project.


------------------------

This is a serial port library for Android, with both JNI API and Java API.

The Java API is bridged to JNI implementation, and not all of the API is strictly tested. Use it at your own risk.

This library is based on wjwwood's cross-platform serial library  https://github.com/wjwwood/serial.
